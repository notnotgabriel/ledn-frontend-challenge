## Introduction

Welcome to the Ledn frontend technical challenge! In this assessment, you'll embark on a unique journey that draws inspiration from the challenges our company has faced in the past and continues to address in the ever-evolving landscape of financial technology.

Our team has encountered scenarios that require a fine balance between technical prowess and creative problem-solving—qualities we believe define an exceptional frontend engineer. To make this experience both engaging and relevant, we've infused the challenge with a touch of creativity, drawing inspiration from an iconic theme.

While the scenario we present is influenced by the Star Wars universe, please note that this is merely a creative backdrop. You won't be navigating the galaxy far, far away, but rather addressing real challenges that our company has encountered or is currently grappling with.

## Starting and submitting the application

1. Create a new private repository on your personal Github account.
2. Copy the content of Ledn challenge in your new private repository.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the application using `npm start`.

## The challenge

### Introduction

Welcome to the Coruscant Bank's engineering department. In a galaxy far, far away, following the fall of the Empire, the financial landscape is in disarray, and you, esteemed engineer, have been entrusted with a crucial mission.

You are now responsible for managing the financial affairs of high-net-worth clients in the tumultuous aftermath of the Empire's collapse. Your role is pivotal as you navigate through the remnants of the Imperial financial system to bring order to the chaos left in its wake.

As the chosen engineer, you have access to critical information:

- **Clients:** A roster of high-net-worth individuals whose fortunes are entwined with the fate of the galaxy.

- **Planets:** The vast array of planets where Coruscant Bank operates, each with its unique economic challenges and opportunities.

- **Transactions:** Detailed records of your clients' financial transactions, recorded in both the now obsolete "Imperial Crown Standard" and the widely accepted "Galactic Credit Standard".

- **Exchange rates:** The fluctuating exchange rates between the "Imperial Crown Standard" and the "Galactic Credit Standard", adding an extra layer of complexity to financial reconciliation.

In the wake of the Empire's fall, the Republic has turned to Coruscant Bank to aid in rectifying the administrative chaos left behind. Your mission is to build the foundation of the administrative application, which will eventually ensure the seamless transition of high-net-worth clients into the new era.

## Requirements

Your task is to design the foundation of a user interface capable of identifying planets susceptible to uprisings and enabling proactive intervention. The objective is to build a software that assists administrators in analyzing transactions across various planets. To meet this goal, adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Transaction filtering:**

   - For each planet, using all users' homeworld as a reference for transaction sources, filter transactions:
     - After a specified date.
     - With a status marked as `inProgress`.
     - Executed in the ICS ("Imperial Crown Standard") currency.

2. **Planetary ranking:**

   - From the transactions filtered previously, order the planets based on the total number of transactions, from the highest to the lowest.

3. **Cumulative transaction values:**

   - From the ordered list of planets, provide real-time cumulative values for all transactions in both ICS ("Imperial Crown Standard") and GCS ("Galactic Credit Standard") for each planet individually.

4. **Security measures:**
   - Implement a solution capable of turning all transactions with a status of `inProgress` for a given planet to `blocked` using a planet ID. This security measure is essential to prevent potential bad actors from exploiting the financial system and transferring funds to the Empire.

### Technical requirements

To ensure the success of your mission, adhere to the following technical specifications:

- **Data format:**

  - Assume the date input for filtering transactions is from an HTML input.
  - Use only the planet ID to build the function that updates the transactions.

- **Technologies & languages:**

  - Use `React Query` to execute all the requests to the endpoints.
  - Build the solution using `Typescript` and `React`.

- **Testing and validation:**
  - Provide comprehensive guidelines for testing your data architecture.
  - Include step-by-step instructions for starting the solution.
